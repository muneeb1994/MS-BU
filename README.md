I created this program as a final project for my graduate Python class at Boston University. 
The program is a movie catalogue which stores data about different movies such as it's name, descriptions, market price of its DVD, and genre.
It reads its classes from a different python file and imports it into the main program. 
The program is interactive and dynamic in nature; It can be expanded and it provides you with the option to choose from different options and go back if needed.
